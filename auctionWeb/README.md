# auctionWeb

This is the web interface for the Auction application.  Not that this interface
exists only for demonstration and testing purposes.  The simulated users interact
directly with the auctionApp's REST API, and do not use this interface, which
would run on the user's browser and not on the server.  As a result, changes to
this code are low priority.
